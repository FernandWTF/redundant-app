# Redundant app mono repo

I put this together 'in one' because of the docker-compose file and later we may use something like yarn workspaces, a CI, etc...

> How do I run the whole project?

Easier than ever, just run:
``` docker-compose up --build ```

And that's it!

It may take some time but at the end you will have the project running on your machine using port 8000 for server and 3000 for the client
